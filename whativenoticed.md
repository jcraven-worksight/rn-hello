## things about developping react-native

#### debugging:
* install vs code extension react-native tools
* if phone screen turns off, need to restart debugging session
* when debugging in vscode, make sure exponent gui app isn't running. 
* `expo whoami` make sure you're logged in before starting debugger.
* `npm run start` via node cli
* `yarn run storybook`

#### since ts added
* `npm run bs` start without vs code debugging, not sure how to get this running from vscode debug
* vscode debug still works, but must run `tsc --watch` in separate process

#### testing
`yarn run test`
