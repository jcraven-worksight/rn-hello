This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).

## my notes about react-native

### setup
* install Expo on mobile device
* install vs code extension react-native tools
* `npm i -g expo`

### how to debug (so far)
* `expo whoami` make sure you're logged in before starting debugger. _not sure if this is necessary?_
* test running and typescript compiling: run `tsc --watch` and `yarn run test` in separate console windows.
* start debugging in vscode. 

### storybook
* `yarn run storybook`

### odd issues I've encountered:
* sometimes you need to spam save to trigger hot reload.
* if the phone screen turns off, need to reconnect in expo
* many red errors in expo with cryptic text ðŸ˜Ÿ
* when debugging in vscode, make sure exponent gui app isn't running on development machine

### alternative debug setup, no vscode but can use browser:
* `npm run bs` start without vs code debugging, not sure how to get this running from vscode debug
